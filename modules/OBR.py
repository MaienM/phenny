# Responses can be forwarded by using the r or l function.
# When forwarded with the r function, the forwarded-to action can be influenced by groups. 
# When forwarded with the l function, any groups for the new action will be ignored.
#   Example: 'noms': r('eats'),
#
#
# If an response is a tupple, one of the values will be chosen at random as response.
#   Example: 'eats': [act('dies'), act('kicks %(nick)s in the face')],
# 
# You can specify a different response for admin/owner as well.
#   Example: 'pets':        act('stares at %(nick)s',
#            'pets admin':  act('purrs'),
#
# You can even specify a different response for other custom groups.
#   Example: 'kicks meanies':  act('nukes %(nick)s'),
#
# You can use '!' to match all actions, or '*' to match all actions with no other actions defined for them.
#   Example '! meanies': act('nukes %(nick)s'),
